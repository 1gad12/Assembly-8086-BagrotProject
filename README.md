# Assembly-8086-BagrotProject
As part of the bagrot I required to do a Assembly 8086 BagrotProject and what we learn in school wasn't enough for me so i learnd more and did my own algoritem to scroll a map in game and here is the result

to play you need to download dosbox
now go to dosbox-options
and write in the bottom "cycles=max"
and drag the exe to the dosbox.exe
